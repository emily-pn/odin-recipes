        <p>These easy lasagna cups taste like the crunchy delicious edges of a lasagna. Made with inside-out pasta shells, filled with meat sauce and cheese, they're a terrific 2-bite lasagna appetizer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar prepared marinara sauce</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a mini muffin pan.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Heat a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and cook, crumbling with a spoon, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain any excess grease. Add onion and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in marinara, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook for 20 minutes, stirring often.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 3 teaspoons salt and pasta to boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and drain well. </li>
            <li>Turn pasta shells inside out and place 24 shells into the prepared muffin pan. Save any broken or remaining shells for another use.</li>
            <li>Fill each shell with about 2 teaspoons ricotta and sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese evenly over the ricotta. Top with about 1 tablespoon meat sauce and top evenly with mozzarella and remaining Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden around the edges and bubbly inside, about 15 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
